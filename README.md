# ProductScraper
This simple python program was created to scrape product names,ratings and prices from any website (uses a 'gaming laptops' search in flipkart with filters applied in the code) and store the data either in a .csv file or .xlsx file. Sample output of the first 24 search results are stored in output.xlsx. Uses Selenium to automate chrome, BeautifulSoup to parse HTML/XML files, and pandas to store scraped data into relevant file formats.
Use of the program requires changing out the identifiers of each tag, apart from the url.
